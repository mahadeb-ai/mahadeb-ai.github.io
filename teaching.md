# 📚 Teaching

As part of my academic journey, I've had the privilege to contribute to various teaching and mentoring activities.

## Courses Assisted

- **MA0002 - Linear Algebra & Differential Equations** - Teaching Assistant (NTU, 2024)
- **MA1008 - Mathematics I** - Teaching Assistant (NTU, 2024)
- **Advanced Mathematics Workshop** - Student Mentor (IIT Bombay, 2023)

## Mentoring

- Supervised 2 undergraduate students in research projects
- Conducted weekly problem-solving sessions for junior students
- Organized study groups for complex mathematical concepts

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in creating an inclusive learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and exploring concepts deeply. My approach combines theoretical foundations with practical applications to make mathematics accessible and engaging.
